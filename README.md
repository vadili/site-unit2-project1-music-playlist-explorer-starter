### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics covered in our lab sessions, while informative, did not fully align with the requirements of the assignment. Most of the content revolved around basic formatting, which was already familiar to the majority of us. However, I did find value in the instruction regarding the proper display of blocks.


* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
The time constraint of three days for completing the project posed a significant challenge. Unfortunately, this led to a sense of rushing through tasks, impacting overall efficiency. Given more time, I would have been able to allocate resources towards implementing additional features and refining the project's design.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Despite the time limitations, the project demo went reasonably well. I managed to achieve all the designated milestones within the given timeframe. However, there were aspirations to incorporate supplementary features, which proved challenging due to the rushed nature of the process. It was amazing to observe the diverse approaches taken by peers in their coding styles. In future endeavors, I aim to explore more creative avenues for visual representation within projects.
